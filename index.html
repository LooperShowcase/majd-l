      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
      kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally
      means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
      used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known
      as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
      sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic
      football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena
      football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby
      league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of
      football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as
      "football codes". There are a number of references to traditional,
      ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the
      world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
      codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th
      century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and
      cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to
      spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled
      Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were
      already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
      incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
      maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in
      England, becoming the first of many professional football associations.
      During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
      become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]
